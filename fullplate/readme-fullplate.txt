Between You And Harm: Armour System Rework for BG2

AD&D's armour system never made sense to me. Characters as
agile and sprightly in full plate as in light leather armour.
Heavy armour not helping one bit if a goblin happens to roll
a 20 when hitting you in the chest with a butterknife. You
get hurt just as bad as the random unarmoured commoner.

And in BG2, AC simply isn't effective after a while. Opponents
autohit you and you them, because of AC not keeping pace with
THAC0 and pluses to hit and whatnot accumulating.

Enter this rework. Light, enchanted armours actually help you
dodge and take a bit of the sting out. Heavy, enchanted armours
don't help dodging much. But they absorb perhaps half or more of
the blow in exchange for slowing you down.

Stealth, thieving and casting in heavy armour is possible,
but difficult.

Heavy armour has quite another feel now. Enjoy.

Do read the updated descriptions. They are informative.

Design notes

- if you have a klutz character with 6 or less DEX ... don't let him try to put on heavy armour. He'll break his neck dressing for battle.
- conflicts with "thieving in heavy armour" and "casting in heavy armour" from BG2 Tweaks, don't install.
- conflicts with "armor refinements" from Refinements, don't install.
- movement penalty purely based on weight.
- light armour:
  * leather, studded, hide, elven chain, shadow dragonscale armours
  * enchantment improves ac quickly
  * enchantment removes weapon speed penalties quickly
  * enchantment lowers thieving penalties quickly
  * enchantment improves damage resistance slowly
  * enchantment lowers weight, move penalties and dex penalties (no sudden halving of weight for +1 armours)
  * enchantment improves spell failure slowly
- heavy armour:
  * scale, (adamantine/mithril) chain, splint, banded, plate, field plate, full plate, (non-shadow) dragonscale armours
  * enchantment improves ac slowly
  * enchantment removes weapon speed penalties slowly
  * enchantment lowers thieving penalties slowly
  * enchantment improves damage resistance quickly
  * enchantment lowers weight, move penalties and dex penalties (no sudden halving of weight for +1 armours)
  * enchantment improves spell failure slowly
