- check for 100%+ armoured creatures
- finer adjustment ... say, 2, 3 or 5% at a time

Design notes

- if you have a klutz character with 6 or less DEX ... don't let him try to put on heavy armour. He'll break his neck dressing for battle.
- conflicts with "thieving in heavy armour" and "casting in heavy armour" from BG2 Tweaks, don't install.
- conflicts with "armor refinements" from Refinements, don't install.
- movement penalty purely based on weight.
- light armour:
  * leather, studded, hide, elven chain, shadow dragonscale armours
  * enchantment improves ac quickly
  * enchantment removes weapon speed penalties quickly
  * enchantment lowers thieving penalties quickly
  * enchantment improves damage resistance slowly
  * enchantment lowers weight, move penalties and dex penalties (no sudden halving of weight for +1 armours)
  * enchantment improves spell failure slowly
- heavy armour:
  * scale, (adamantine/mithril) chain, splint, banded, plate, field plate, full plate, (non-shadow) dragonscale armours
  * enchantment improves ac slowly
  * enchantment removes weapon speed penalties slowly
  * enchantment lowers thieving penalties slowly
  * enchantment improves damage resistance quickly
  * enchantment lowers weight, move penalties and dex penalties (no sudden halving of weight for +1 armours)
  * enchantment improves spell failure slowly
